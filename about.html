Hey there! My name is Arvind and I am a Master's student, specializing in computer security, at Amrita University.
I am currently exploring reverse code engineering and pwnables and will post about my explorations here.
I also occasionally blog at <a href="http://arvindsraj.wordpress.com">http://arvindsraj.wordpress.com.</a>
<br /> <br />
This is a fairly new site and I'm a novice web designer so do let me know your thoughts on my site.
